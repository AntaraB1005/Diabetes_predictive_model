# Diabetes_predictive_model
INSPIRATION

Creation of a Machine Learning Model with the use of KNN and Decision Trees Algorithm to accurately predict whether or not patients have Diabetes from the provided dataset.

DETAILS

The dataset has been originally derived from a larger database of National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases consisting of several medical predictor variables and one target variable Outcome. Prediction output are in the form of One and Zero. A Classification Model has been created with use of KNN and Decision trees algorithm. Prior to modelling the dataset has undergone Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis. Model has been trained on Jupyter Notebook Environment with use of Python Language.
